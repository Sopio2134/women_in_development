                <h3 id="paragraph1">Anatomy of HTML document</h3>
                <p>As we all know HTML is a language of the web. It’s used to design the web pages or we can say structure the page layouts of a website.  HTML stands for HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE, as its full form suggests it’s not any programming language, a markup language. So, while the execution of HTML code we can’t face any such error. In real HTML code wasn’t compiled or interpreted because HTML code was rendered by the browser. which is similar to the compilation of a program. Html content is parched through the browser to display the content of HTML. Html used predefined tags and attributes to tell the browser how to display content, means in which format, style, font size, and images to display. Html is a case insensitive language. Case insensitive means there is no difference in upper case and lower case ( capital and small letters) both treated as the same, for r example ‘D’ and ‘d’ both are the same here.</p>
        
                <h3 id="paragraph2">Links, URLs, Paths</h3>
                <p>Images are added to HTML using the <img> tag. You will notice that it doesn’t have a closing tag. <br>This is because it does not have any content inside it, so it doesn’t require one. The "<img>" element always have to have one attribute: the src. The src attribute of the image is the URL to the photo. What? Photos can have URLs? Yup, that’s right. Remember, when you visit a website the server simply sends you an HTML file.Links are what make the entire internet an internet - links interconnecting different sites and pages. They are made using the <a> tag, which stands for anchor.Now, it’s time to add the image to your index.html file. But what’s the URL? We are going to use something called a relative URL. A relative URL is a URL relative to the HTML file. The file is currently in your main folder (in these examples its called [website-folder], but it doesn’t matter what it is). Relative URLs do not start with file://, http:// or https://. They just start with a file path, assuming you are in the current folder.</p>

                <h3 id="paragraph3">Tables</h3>
                <p>The HTML element represents tabular data—that is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.The table box establishes a table formatting context. Elements inside the table generate rectangular boxes. Each box occupies a number of table cells according to the following rules: The row boxes fill the table in the source code order from top to bottom. Each row box occupies one row of cells. A row group box occupies one or more row boxes. Column boxes are placed next to each other in source code order. Depending on the value of the dir attribute, the columns are laid in left-to-right or right-to-left direction. A column box occupies one or more columns of table cells. A column group box occupies one or more column boxes. A cell box may span over multiple rows and columns. User agents trim cells to fit in the available number of rows and columns. Table cells do have padding. Boxes that make up a table do not have margins.</p>
